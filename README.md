 With no wifi, and no experience, can I outmaster the quants in big hedge funds and predict future prices off prices I made up on my own?

Explore with me my attempt at creating a nice portfolio for the quants to look at and probably be confused.
Slowly it will get better and maybe at the end I will have a professional model to work with. Got lots of cool ideas for models I want to try out. Lets see how it goes!

## Chapter 1: 
I explore if I can make any simple model which can predict the future prices. I had no wifi while doing this, and no experience. I could have made the code and methods better but I was writing this while chilling at the beach. Mathematical and statistical rigour was traded for my own entertainment purposes.
