 With no wifi, can I outmaster the quants in big hedge funds and predict future prices off prices I made up on my own?

Explore with me my attempt at creating a nice portfolio for the quants to look at and probably be confused.
Slowly it will get better and maybe at the end I will have a professional model to work with. Got lots of cool ideas for models I want to try out. Lets see how it goes!
